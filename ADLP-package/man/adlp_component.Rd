\item{calc_cdf}{function to calculate the cdf of each point}

\item{sim_fun}{function to simulate new from}
}
\value{
Object of class `adlp_component`
}
\description{
Class to store component models and related functions required for ADLP
estimation, prediction and goodness of fit.
}
\details{
Component models `model_train` and `model_full` are designed to be objects of
class `glm`, `lm`, or similar. The models would desirably have a S3 method for
`formula. For models that do not fit under this umbrella,
see \link[custom_model]{custom_model}. For a potential list of candidate models,
one might refer to Avanzi, Li, Wong and Xian (2022).

Functions as assumed to have the following parameter naming convention:
\itemize{
 \item{`y` as the response variable}
 \item{`model` as the modeling object `model_train` or `model_full`}
 \item{`newdata` to designate new data}
}
Other inputs not in this list will need to be intialised with the `adlp_component`
