\usage{
\method{predict}{adlp}(object, newdata = NULL, ...)

adlp_dens(adlp, newdata, model = c("train", "full"))

adlp_logS(adlp, newdata, model = c("train", "full"), epsilon = 1e-08)

\arguments{
\item{newdata}{Data to perform the function on}

\item{adlp}{Object of class `adlp`}

\item{model}{Whether the `train` or `full` model should be used in function}

\item{epsilon}{Offset added to the density before calculating the log}

\item{lower}{The lower limit to calculate CRPS}

\item{upper}{The upper limit to calculate CRPS}

\item{sample_n}{The number of values to sample between lower and upper}

\item{n}{number of simulations}
}
\value{
`data.frame` of results, where the first and second columns correspond
to the `$origin` and `$dev` columns from the triangles. An index column for
`simulation #` is also included when simulating ADLP.
}
\description{
Family of functions used to support ADLP inference and prediction.
}
\details{
Predicts the central estimates based on the ADLP component models and weights.

Calculates the probability density ad each point, given `newdata`.

Calculates the log score, which is the log of the probability density, with
an offset `epsilon` to handle zero densities.
 Log Score is a strictly proper scoring rule.
For full discussion of the mathematical details and
advantages of Log Score, one might refer to Gneiting and Raftery (2007)

Continuously Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) is calculated for each data point.
`lower` and `upper` are used as limits when approximating the integral.
CRPS is a strictly proper scoring rule.
For full discussion of the mathematical details and
advantages of CRPS, one might refer to Gneiting and Raftery (2007).
The CRPS function has been discretized in this context to ensure
adaptability to various distributions.
For details, one might refer to
Gneiting and Ranjan (2011)

Simulations of ADLP predictions, given component models and ADLP weights.
